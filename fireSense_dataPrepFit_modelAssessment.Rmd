# the requisite input objects (mainly the cohortData/pixelGroup objects output by Biomass_borealDataPrep

If the relationship between LCCs and their historical propensity to burn is similar in the study area as the rest of Canada,
we should see more fire in forest generally (1:15, 20, 32), with broadleaf/mixed less flammable (2:5, 11:15), and in non-forest, more fire in shrubland/grassland 'high flammable non-forest' category comprising 16, 17, 18, 19, 22. There should be little to no fire in the 'low flammable non-forest' 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, though depending on sample size this might vary. The non-flammable classes 25, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38, and 39 should have no fire.
